<h1>TVPage Web Developer Test </h1>

<p>Develop a web app that given an url, will give insight to what domains that web page is linking. In addition to the start url a link depth can be specified. In that case all pages within link depth distance should be part of the analysis.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
Use a (probably) free cloud platform to host the app or run locally and send instructions on how to run.
<br />
As a minimum the result should:
<ol>
<li>list all domains</li>
<li>per domain have a drop down with the list of url in that domain.</li>
<li>some graphic charts, for example a histogram.</li>
<li>a responsive design: background processing while having a functional web page. </li>
<li>Or request can be queued; submitting a query while investigating a previous result.</li>

<h2>Additional features:</h2>
Add a mechanism to identify returning users and show them a history of searches.

<h2>To be delivered:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fair estimation of the number of hours spent.</li>
<li>The url to a working web site.</li>
<li>All code behind it, both static and dynamic contents, in a comprehensible way.</li>
<li>Short document describing:</li>
<li>Functionality with pointers to the code; document should introduce code base, not replicate what can be read in <li>the code itself.</li>
<li>Status of work</li>
<li>Whatâ€™s finished</li>
<li>Todos</li>
<li>Suggestions for improvements</li>
<li>Additional deliverable:</li>
<li>Suggestions how to test the web site</li>
<li>Unit tests for the code</li>
</ul>
